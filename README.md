# Progress widget
Ok so i made this about 2 years ago just as a proof of concept, but i think it could have potential one day so im going to upload it here in the chance that i dont forget about it

Its kind of terrible
- only works for my specific resolution, 1080p
- has not controls and runs in a constant unstoppable loop
- spotify token closes after like 10 minutes and the app just breaks,
- uses unnecessary packages
- probably poorly optimised idk i made it when i was 14 dont judge

This is kind of what i intended to replace this stupid widget, but it has a long way to go.  
So the thought is instead of that weather widget thing, it would show what youre currently listening to, and on click or hover would open the flyout as shown above.
