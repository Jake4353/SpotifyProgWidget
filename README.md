# SpotifyProgWidget
Ok so i made this about 2 years ago just as a proof of concept, but i think it could have potential one day so im going to upload it here in the chance that i dont forget about it

Its kind of terrible
- only works for my specific resolution, 1080p
- has not controls and runs in a constant unstoppable loop
- spotify token closes after like 10 minutes and the app just breaks,
- uses unnecessary packages
- probably poorly optimised idk i made it when i was 14 dont judge
